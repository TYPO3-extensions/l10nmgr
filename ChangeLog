	* A "Translation Tasks" module which is destined to be a "task center" for translators including listing of explicitly set priorities by webmasters.
	* An translation index table which helps us to make a overview of what translations are pending. This also needs more adaption.
	* Some of this may depend on core-hooks which are upcoming.
	* Expecting to finish these features for a "first real version" in January 2008 for Dassault. Until then, use at own risk.
